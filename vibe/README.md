Vibe is a web application that takes user's mood input and their Spotify data to create a personalized playlist for them in that moment. Vibe would be used in various ways like reading current users mood and creating playlists on the spot or even expanding past moods, and basing it on genres or loudness of music. With Full Stack Development tools at our hands, we can make Vibe a reality.
